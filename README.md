# CWhatIMean
C programs for the soul

These are C programs for practice / submission purposes. Hush, they're fairly cool.

# CheccTime
This one is cool. It uses system calls to modify file permissions of a file, if the file has been opened / modified in the past 2 hours. Then, it prints the access, modification, and status times of the file in question.

# ReaderWriter
This is basically providing a solution to the readers-writers problem using semaphores. When compiling this, make sure to do " -pthread", otherwise it won't work.
